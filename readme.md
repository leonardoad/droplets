# Droplets

Droplets is an engaging and fun game where you control a droplet on an infinite run. The game is built using Javascript, providing a smooth and interactive gaming experience.

## Game Overview

In Droplets, you control a single droplet in a mode similar to subway surfer. The game is an infinite run with gravity on. The droplet gets quicker with each droplet joined. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible and accumulate the highest score.

## How to Play

1. Start the game.
2. Control the droplet using the arrows or A,W,S,D.
3. Join with other droplets to increase your speed.
4. Avoid cracks and dust on the window to survive longer.

## Scoring

You earn points for each second you stay in the game. The quicker your droplet, the more points you earn. The game keeps track of your top score, so you can always strive to beat your personal best!

## Technology Used

This game was built using Javascript. Javascript was chosen for its versatility and wide support across all modern web browsers. It allows for interactive elements, which is crucial for a game like Droplets. Javascript also supports event-driven programming, which is ideal for user interactions in a game. Moreover, with Javascript, we can utilize various libraries and frameworks to enhance the game's performance and user experience. The use of Javascript also enables the game to be easily accessible on the web, providing a seamless gaming experience without the need for any additional software installation.

## Future Improvements

We're constantly working to improve Droplets. Here are some features we're planning to add:

- Background image: We're working on making the droplets transparent so it looks like they're in front of the background.
- More game modes: We're planning to add more exciting game modes to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting.

Stay tuned for these updates!

  -  


## DONE
- show counter with top score
- create droplets at random intervals
- make droplets move like a real droplet
- animate the droplet like it is hitting the glass on show up
- Add controls for the parameters
